    <pre> My name is Sanjida Emu, and I am a student of Computer Science and Engineering (BCSE). 
    I am a curious and hardworking person who always tries to learn new things, especially in the field of cybersecurity and technology. 
    I enjoy exploring how systems work and how they can be protected from threats. Besides my studies, I like reading, listening to music, and spending time with my family and friends.
